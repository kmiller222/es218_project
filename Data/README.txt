This dataset lists vehicular accidents recorded by the NHTSA for the years 1996 through 2016. Column descriptions can be found in the column_name_description.csv file. Supporting lookup tables include alcohol.csv, body_typ.csv, inj_sev.csv, man_coll.csv, sex.csv, and state_code.csv. A PDF manual is also available with additional documentation (note that the manual lists many more variables not present in this dataset).

NOTE: Each accident event can be reported across several lines if more than one vehicle and/or more than one person was involved. For example, the first four records in the data represent a single event (2 vehicles with two persons in each vehicle).
